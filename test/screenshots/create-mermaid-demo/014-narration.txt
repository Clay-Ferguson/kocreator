We've entered our diagram description and the Mermaid code. Notice the code is surrounded by triple backticks with "mermaid" as the language identifier — this tells MkBrowser to render it as a diagram. The code itself uses simple text syntax: nodes in brackets, arrows for connections, and optional styling. It's much easier than drawing diagrams manually! Now watch what happens when we save.
