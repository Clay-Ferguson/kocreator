Incredible! The simple text code has been transformed into a beautiful, professional diagram. You can see all the components of our web application — the browser, frontend React app, backend API, database, cache, message queue, and background worker — all connected with labeled arrows showing how data flows through the system. The color-coded components make it even easier to understand. This makes MkBrowser perfect for documenting system architectures, planning new features, or explaining technical designs to your team. No special diagram tools needed — just write your Mermaid code and MkBrowser handles the rest.
